                                There are many different dartboards in use, however, the image to the left illustrates the one sanctioned by the World Darts Federation and used in professional
                                competitions of 501 Darts. It consists of concentric rings marked with numbers. Hitting a sector within the board scores the number, hitting the outer ring scores double
                                the number and the inner ring treble the number. The outer bull scores 25 and the inner 50. Standard height of the bull is 173 cm. The standard throwing distance, marked by a raised
                                    plinth called the oche, is 237cm.

                                    The bristle dartboard is the most common dartboard made of sisal fibres glued to a backing board, with the edges held by metal banding. These fibres close together when
                                    you remove a dart from the board. The numbers are arranged out of sequence in what is called the "1-20 clock" pattern.

                                Modern darts have four parts: The points, the barrels, the shafts and the flights. There are 2 common lengths for the barrels,
                                    32mm and 41mm and are sometimes knurled or coated to improve grip. Others are designed to retract slightly on impact to lessen the chance of bouncing out.
                                     Shafts are generally made from plastics, nylon polymers, or metals such as aluminium and titanium; and can be rigid or flexible. Some sample titanium shafted darts are shown to

                                        Normal usage of the word "Darts"  refers to a game whereby the player throws three darts per visit to the board with the goal of reducing a score (501 but can be any value) to zero.

                        <Run>In a game of 501 the object is for one player or a team to be the first to reach zero from starting total of 501. Normally 2 people or teams will take part but in
                            actual fact any number may play. After three darts are thrown, the player subtracts the total scored from his current total until he reaches zero. 
                            To reach zero each player must finish by throwing a double that is if player one has 40 remaining he must hit double 20 to win and so on. It is also possible to finish
                            with the Bullseye if the player required 50 to finish at any point. Some versions of the game require a 'double start' whereby players must begin the game 
                            with a double as well as 'checking out' on a double. Games can be played to a 'Best of' format whereby a player or team winning three legs in a 'Best of Five Leg' competition wins the match.

                                   Cricket is typically played between at least 2 players or teams of players. The goal is to be the first player to open or close all the cricket numbers
                                        and have a higher or even point total.    Cricket uses the numbers 15 to 20 and the bull's-eye. To open or close a number, 
                                        it must have been scored 3 times in any fashion, on one or more turns. Hitting the triple will open or close a number in one throw; 
                                        a single and the double will open or close it in two throws or three singles will open or close it in three throws. 
                                        Numbers can be opened or closed in any particular order and several numbers can be hit in the same turn.

                                   If you select a standard darts game (501 for example) you will see the screen that appears to the left of this text. After each turn click the place on the board corresponding to the
                                        score for each dart. The display to the top middle will show the each dart value and the running total. Once all three darts have been set a dialog will appear in the centre of the board. Click the green tick to accept them or the read cross to enter again if you make a mistake.
                                        To register no score simply click the edge of the board (when in normal dartboard mode only) or on the large 0 to the left of the board. 
                                        After this the next player will be selected and play continues. When a player wins the Leg/Sets score is updated and the
                                        first player in the next leg is rotated as per competition play. When one player has won the correct number of legs and sets the match ends and you can
                                        start again. Note that by default checkout hints are turned on; when you reach a score that can be checked out they will appear in the top right hand corner
                                        and the relevant sections of the dartboard will flash to indicate the next number to go for. If you miss your checkout, the next three hints are still shown so
                                        you can set up for an easier checkout next time.

                                   If you select the cricket game you will see the screen to the right.  In this case it is using the simplified board to do the scoring. This is useful
                                        for small screen sizes where it is hard to precisely click the correct part of the board. The doubles and the trebles have been made much large to aid
                                        clicking. You can switch between the different boards at any time by clicking the dartboard icon at the top right of the board. The last setting will be remembered.
                                        The open and closed cricket numbers will be tracked in the player section, open are green and closed are red, in addition the following symbols are used
                                        to indicate how many of each number has been hit:  / = 1, X = 2 and Ø = 3

                                        Clicking on a closed number will not produce a score. When all numbers are closed or when only one player can score the game will end.
                                        Note that checkout hints are not implemented for the cricket game.

                                    When you score a match in Score Master, if you have allocated a Player or Players to one of the slots on the New Game screen, then various statistics
                                        will be tracked for those players. In statistics view, clicking the Chart icon will slide in the detailed statistics screen, where  you can see various
                                        statistics based on the performance of the player. For example Checkout percentage and 3 dart average
                                        are important ones, note that Darts/Leg average is the value for legs that you have won. To remove the statistics screen you can click on the statistics button
                                        or simple swipe left on it if you have a touch screen. Note that incomplete matches are not added to the cummulative statistics.
